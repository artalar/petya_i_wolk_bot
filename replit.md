## Technology Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Bot Framework**: Grammy.dev
- **Payment Provider**: YooKassa
- **Session Storage**: File-based (@grammyjs/storage-file)
- **Logging**: Pino with pretty printing

## Environment Configuration

### Secrets (Encrypted)
- `BOT_TOKEN`: Telegram bot token from @BotFather
- `YOOKASSA_SHOP_ID`: YooKassa merchant ID
- `YOOKASSA_SECRET_KEY`: YooKassa API secret key

### Environment Variables (Shared)
- `BOT_NAME`: Bot username (e.g., Petya_and_wolk_bot)
- `ADMIN_GROUP_ID`: Chat ID for order notifications
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (defaults to 'development')

## Running the Bot

### Development Mode
The bot runs automatically via the "Telegram Bot" workflow using:
```bash
npm run dev
```
This uses `tsx watch` for hot-reloading during development.

### Production Mode
```bash
npm run build    # Compile TypeScript
npm start        # Run compiled code
```

## Important Notes
- This is a backend service (no frontend/web interface)
- The bot communicates via Telegram's API
- Sessions are stored in the `sessions/` directory
- Database is stored in `db.json` (file-based)
- All environment variables are already configured in Replit Secrets

## Bot Commands
- `/start` - Begin new order
- `/menu` - Show drink menu
- `/admin` - Admin panel (for authorized users)

## Payment Testing
See the following documentation files for YooKassa integration:
- `YOOKASSA_SETUP.md` - Setup and deployment guide
- `YOOKASSA_TEST_GUIDE.md` - Testing instructions
- `YOOKASSA_TEST_DATA.md` - Test cards and scenarios

## Deployment
This bot is currently running in development mode on Replit. For production deployment, ensure:
1. All environment variables are set correctly
2. YooKassa account is in production mode (not test mode)
3. Bot webhook is properly configured (if using webhooks instead of polling)
